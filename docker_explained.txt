If you want to copy the contents of one drive to antoher you create a disk image. You can flash disk images onto a drive. 
Original Disk --> Disk Image --> Drive's that need a copy.
Docker images work similarly, but are layered. 
Layers example:
Ubuntu + ROS + Custom ROS
They will all share ubuntu, the last two share the ROS, and the CUSTOM ROS only shares with itself. 
Dockerfile:
Existing docker image + our dockerfile = custom docker image
Container: 
Docker image -> run -> docker Container
Disk image -> flashing -> Disk
Note here: Running is like flashing. So if you want to use your saved changes you need to use start/stop container.
